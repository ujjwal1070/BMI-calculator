                  Body mass index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms
                  divided by the square of height in meters. It is an
                  inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight
                  categories that may lead to health problems.

                  A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI does not
                  measure body fat directly, but BMI is correlated with more
                  direct measures of body fat.

                  For children and teens,however, BMI is age and sex specific
                  and is expressed as a percentile obtained from either a graph
                  or a percentile calculator and is not a diagnostic tool.
                  Instead it is used to screen for potential weight and
                  health-related issues.
